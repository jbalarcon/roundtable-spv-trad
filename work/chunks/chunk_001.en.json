      "source_md": "* **Risk isolation and liability protection:** An SPV's primary advantage is **shielding the parent company** or main fund from the financial risks and legal liabilities of a specific project. Because it is a \"bankruptcy-remote entity,\" its operations can continue even if the parent company faces insolvency, making it ideal for high-stakes ventures.  \n* **Tax strategy:** SPVs can provide **tax benefits**, often through a pass-through structure that avoids double taxation at the entity level. They can be used strategically to minimize tax on specific transactions, such as property sales, and can be established in favorable jurisdictions to reduce overall tax burdens.  \n* **Investor access and control:** For investors, SPVs offer **visibility and active decision-making** on a deal-by-deal basis, a level of control not typically found in traditional funds. The structure also enables lower investment minimums, making alternative assets accessible to a broader range of investors.  \n* **Strategic benefits for founders and GPs:** Founders benefit from a simplified cap table, as multiple investors are consolidated into a single entity. For emerging fund managers (GPs), SPVs are an effective tool for **building an investment track record** before raising a larger, traditional fund.  \n* **Financial and operational efficiency:** The SPV structure **streamlines complex transactions** like project financing or asset transfers, reducing administrative workload. It can improve access to capital and help secure better financing terms by isolating specific assets. "

This complexity can lead to a lack of transparency and challenges in accurately valuing the assets held by the vehicle, placing a significant due diligence burden on all parties.  \n* **Regulatory scrutiny:** The features that make SPVs useful, such as legal separation and opacity, can be exploited. Historically, they have been misused in high-profile cases to hide debt and inflate earnings. They can also be used in aggressive international structures for tax avoidance, which has led to **increased scrutiny from global bodies.**  \n* **Operational and counterparty risks:** Setting up and managing an SPV involves **significant costs, time, and administrative effort**. The vehicle is also dependent on external parties like servicers and administrators; the failure of any key counterparty can disrupt cash flows and create significant operational or market risks.  \n* **Regulatory risk:** SPVs are **vulnerable to changes** in the legal and financial landscape. New accounting standards, evolving tax laws (like [BEPS initiatives](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/services/tax/base-erosion-profit-shifting-beps)), or stricter financial regulations (like [AIFMD](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2011/61/oj/eng)) can impose new costs and compliance burdens, potentially altering an SPV’s financial viability overnight"

It owns its own assets, incurs liabilities, enters into contracts, and maintains a separate balance sheet, a feature that is fundamental to its operation.  \n* **Limited purpose:** An SPV is a **\"fenced organisation\"** created for a singular, specific purpose. Its governing documents strictly limit its activities to a predefined objective, such as holding a particular asset, which prevents it from taking on unrelated debts or business lines.  \n* **Bankruptcy remoteness:** A primary goal of the structure is to make the SPV \"bankruptcy-remote\". This **insulates the SPV’s assets** from its parent’s creditors in case of insolvency, and vice versa. *Note: \"remote\" does not mean \"immune\" – a court can still challenge the SPV's separation from its parent in exceptional circumstances.*  \n* **Custom capital structure:** To enhance its independence, an SPV often has a custom capital structure with **minimal equity.** In an \"orphan\" structure, ownership can be held by an independent third party, like a trustee, instead of the sponsor.  \n* **Defined lifespan:** Many SPVs are designed to be temporary, **dissolving once their specific purpose is fulfilled,** such as when a project is completed or a financing is repaid. Others may be ongoing but remain strictly limited to their original venture."
