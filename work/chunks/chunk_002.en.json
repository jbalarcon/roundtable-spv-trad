From day one, the legal agreements should **clearly document exit mechanics, payment waterfalls, and wind-down procedures** to avoid future deadlocks.  \n* **Operational integrity:** Maintain **strict operational separation** from the sponsor, with separate bank accounts, books, and records. Where possible, automate back-office processes using integrated platforms to manage costs and administrative work effectively.  \n* **Transparent reporting and compliance:** Establish a **fixed timetable** for audited, investor-grade reporting. It is essential to implement strict AML/KYC workflows for all investors and continuously track evolving regulations, such as SEC and EU rules, to ensure ongoing compliance.  \n* **Proactive risk management:** Before launch, secure legal opinions confirming the SPV's bankruptcy-remote status.
